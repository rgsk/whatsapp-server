// prune heroku config
since we want dev dependencies installed too
yarn start uses ts-node
// also installing ts-node as dependency not works

For unknown reasons Heroku prunes ts-node as 
dev dependency even if you listed it in dependencies instead of devDependencies.
 What should you do is to instruct Heroku not to prune devDependencies with the command:
// set
 NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false 
 YARN_PRODUCTION=false
